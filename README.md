psutils
=======

A collection of command line utilities written in Powershell, proudly ignoring Powershell Verb-Noun naming conventions.

These are designed to be installed with [Scoop](http://scoop.sh).

* *runat* - A replacement for the `at` command which Microsoft has deprecated and removed in Windows 2012.
* *vimtutor* - The `vimtutor` that comes with Vim for Windows doesn't work with Scoop (it's a .bat file). This one does.
